                    <p>This is the Thesis Project for my MA in Web Design and Content Planning in the University of Greenwich in London.

                    <p class="italicparagraph">
                    Here is my Elevator Pitch:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I am a Web Designer in Development and I love cacti as many others do as well. However we do not have a proper source of “cactiness” to rely on. This is why I take it upon myself to create a unique website which would re-introduce the amazing world of cacti to everyone.
                    <br/>
                    This project would grant me the opportunity to demonstrate my web designer skills in both technical and design aspects.
                    <br/>
                    The website that I intend to create will be an eye candy full of unique, entertaining and fun content such as jokes, images, videos, short articles. The website’s graphics will create the feeling that cacti are truly idolized. This effect will be achieved by the use of topical to cacti elements throughout the design of each page such as thorns, colour and environment.

                    <p>This is my first freelance project. It involved creating a promotional website for a small business for electrical services. The main purpose was to effectively showcase the services and products that the business provides. The main goal was not to make sales through the website, but increase the number of clients who directly contact the business.</p>
