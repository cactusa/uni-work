            <h2>My development as a professional.</h2>
            <p>After high school I decided to continue my education in the area I was particularly interested in - computer science. I spent four years gaining technical knowledge of programming, logic, algorithms, databases, etc. The highly theoretical way of education in the University of Edinburgh helped me to develop very adaptable programming skills. I can pick up any new programming language with ease. Having tasted the technical material of computer science I wanted to do something expressive and creative. Web Design and Development was the perfect match for me. It gave me the opportunity to use my programming knowledge within a creative process. The MA in Web Design and Content Planning was the natural way to go forward. The programme managed to provide the crucial creative bit that I was missing in order to turn me into a well rounded Web Designer in Development.</p>
            <p>Now I claim with confidence that I possess the enthusiasm of a graduate, but also the credibility of a person used to the working environment.</p>
